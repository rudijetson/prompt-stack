# Backend & Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Backend Cleanup

### Files Removed
1. **`backend/test_security_smoke.py`** - Duplicate test logic
2. **`backend/app/services/llm_service.py`** - Old LLM service (using organized version in llm/)
3. **`backend/app/services/supabase_client.py`** - Old Supabase client (using organized version in supabase/)
4. **`backend/app/api/endpoints/example.py`** - Unnecessary template file

### Files Kept
- **`backend/app/api/endpoints/dev.py`** - Useful development endpoints (properly secured)
- All organized service directories (llm/, supabase/, vectordb/)
- All model files properly separated by domain

## Result

### Before
- 25+ documentation files with overlapping content
- Duplicate backend services from refactoring
- Mix of user docs and development notes
- Confusing file organization

### After
- 12 focused documentation files
- Clean backend structure with no duplicates
- Clear separation of concerns
- User-friendly documentation structure

### Benefits
1. **Clearer for new users** - No confusion from development notes
2. **Easier maintenance** - Single source of truth for each topic
3. **Better organization** - Logical file structure
4. **AI-friendly** - CLAUDE.md has clear build instructions

The codebase is now clean, organized, and ready for fresh testing!
